Project: {project}

Tasks:
1. From quality_gate.json, extract:
   - Overall Quality Gate status (OK/WARN/ERROR)
   - Failed conditions (metric, comparator, threshold, actual)

2. Compare against KPI rules:
   - Coverage <80% overall or <85% new code → fail
   - Duplications ≥3% → fail
   - New ratings not A → fail
   - New Critical/Blocker issues >0 → fail

3. Output format:
   - First, state the overall Quality Gate status
   - Then, list each failed condition with actual vs threshold, mark status, and reason
   - End with a one-sentence conclusion on whether the project passes KPI requirements overall
