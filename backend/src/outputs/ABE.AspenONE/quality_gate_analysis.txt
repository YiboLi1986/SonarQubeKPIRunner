Based on the provided `quality_gate.json`, here are the results:

**Overall Quality Gate Status:** ERROR
**Failed Conditions:**

1. **Coverage** (new_coverage)
	* Actual: 0.0% 
	* Threshold: 80%
	* Status: FAIL (violates "Coverage <80% overall or <85% new code → fail" KPI rule)
	* Reason: Coverage threshold is not met, as actual coverage is significantly below the required 80%.
2. **Duplications** (new_duplicated_lines_density)
	* Actual: 0.0%
	* Threshold: 3%
	* Status: WARN (violates "Duplications ≥3% → fail" KPI rule)
	* Reason: Duplications threshold is not exceeded, as actual duplications are at 0%.

**Conclusion:** The project fails to meet the required KPI thresholds for coverage and does not exceed the duplication threshold.
