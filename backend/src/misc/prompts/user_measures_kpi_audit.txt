Tasks:
1. Extract KPI values from measures.json:
   - Coverage (overall %, new code %)
   - Duplications (overall %, new code %)
   - Ratings: Reliability, Security, Maintainability
   - Bugs count, Vulnerabilities count
   - Code Smells count
   - Technical Debt (sqale_index in minutes)

2. Compare against KPI thresholds:
   - Coverage should be ≥80% overall and ≥85% new code
   - Duplications should be <3%
   - Ratings should all be A (1.0)
   - Bugs = 0
   - Vulnerabilities = 0

3. Output format:
   - Use a clear bullet list or table
   - For each KPI: show actual value, threshold, status, and a short reason (e.g., "Actual 0%, below 80%")
   - End with a one-sentence overall conclusion about KPI compliance
